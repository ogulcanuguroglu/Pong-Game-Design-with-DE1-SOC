# Pong-Game-Design-with-DE1-SOC
The aim of this project extends beyond just creating a game; itâ€™s about melding
hardware and software to construct a rich and engaging interactive experience.
The game is designed to be a digital Pong game, a classic in the realm of
video games, using VGA display technology to render the game interface and
elements. It allows two players to control individual paddles and use them to
hit a ball back and forth on screen. The unique feature of this game is that it
is not created through typical game development software or coding languages
such as C++, Python, or JavaScript. Instead, it is entirely programmed using
VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language), a language primarily used
for describing digital and mixed-signal systems such as Field-Programmable
Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and integrated circuits. The core game logic and screen
rendering processes are all built into the hardware, with VHDL providing the
link between the game logic and the physical display. The victory condition of
the game is based on a points system - a player needs to score 3 points to win.
